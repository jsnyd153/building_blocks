As a new normal takes shape, we’re helping our clients redesign their operating models, navigate consolidation, and meet ambitious sustainability imperatives. Our clients include virtually every major aircraft and engine manufacturer, component creators, commercial transport companies, makers of jet propulsion systems, and dozens of key suppliers and service providers.</p>

                                                            We understand the seismic forces reshaping business for defense contractors today. Amid extraordinary budgetary pressures, new entrants are emerging around the globe as corporate consolidation continues across the industry. While capital is sometimes abundant, it is harder than ever to find and harness the right talent. To thrive, established companies must become more agile, getting products to market faster than ever—customers increasingly expect this, and at lower cost. We can help you adapt to these trends, with a proven track record built on successful engagements with virtually every A&D prime and dozens of Tier I/II suppliers.

                                                            Lower launch costs, smaller satellites, reusable rockets: the “space race” has evolved from a battle of superpowers to an increasingly accessible business proposition. As commercial aerospace companies redefine the market, and as huge investments flow from venture capitalists, the barriers to entry are falling in ways that were once unthinkable. This creates profound opportunities for companies involved with spacecraft launches, mission control, and services for geostationary and lower-earth orbit products. But it also means intense competition. We can help you thrive in this brave new frontier.

We can help you modernize IT systems, control costs, and recruit top talent. Our global footprint and wide-ranging expertise give us a deep understanding of what it takes to win in a sector characterized by rapidly evolving market dynamics, shifting regulations, and new competitors.
